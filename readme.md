# Manipulation

No link. PHP exercises, the server-related instructions won't work.

## What I learned


### String Manipulation

* Reverse: https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.strrev.php
* Capitalize: https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.strtoupper.php
* Lower cases: https://www.php.net/manual/fr/function.strtolower.php
* Shuffle: https://www.php.net/manual/fr/function.str-shuffle.php
* Replace/add characters: https://php.net/substr_replace
* Random number: https://www.php.net/manual/fr/function.rand.php
* Wrap: https://www.php.net/manual/fr/function.wordwrap.php

### Object/Array Manipulation

* Push new item in a regular array: https://www.php.net/manual/fr/function.array-push.php
* Choose a random key in an array: https://www.php.net/manual/fr/function.array-rand.php
* Probability of an event: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9252671/how-do-i-execute-one-event-in-php-based-on-a-probability-for-the-event-to-happen
* Chunk (split) array: https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.array-chunk.php
* Round the counting to next number if the array can't be divided by two: https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.ceil.php
* Remove last element of an array: https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.array-pop.php
* Set cookie for object (using JSON): https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20096825/object-to-cookie-in-php

## Difficulties

* In the string manipulation exercise, I didn't manage to achieve the bonus instruction. I've found a bypass using the "background-clip" property in CSS.
* In the object manipulation exercise, I had a hard time understanding how to add array 1 and 2 into the object and echo them with the part of the object previously set. I can echo the added arrays but not with the first part of the object. But in the var_dump you can see that everything is in the object. Got help from Raf for explanations.


## Feedback

In the object manipulation exercise, I didn't understand the purpose of the "for" loop to add an item in the arrays. Unless I misunderstood the instruction...
